# A Field Experiment - News Articles and Happiness
A field experiment we ran end to end as a part of a Statistics class.  Our objective was to measure whether exposure to positive news articles had a causal effect on a person’s happiness.

We conducted a field experiment by sorting subjects into control and treatment groups daily and sent a happy article to the treatment group and a neutral article to the control group. Our evaluation showed promise of a positive causal effect of reading a happy article on a subject’s mood, but we were not able to conclude that the treatment effect was statistically significant, potentially due to the limited sample size of our experiment (59 subjects).
